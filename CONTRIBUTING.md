# Contributing

The `do-operator` project makes use of the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) development workflow.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/issues/new) or find an [existing issue](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/issues) that you'd like to take on.
This ensures that efforts are not duplicated, and that a new feature aligns with the focus of the rest of the repository.

Once your suggestion has been submitted and discussed, please be sure that your code meets the following criteria:
  - `make test` passes
  - new features or codepaths have appropriate test coverage

Finally, submit a pull request for review!
